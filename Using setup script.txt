Using setup.py for Worker Node Deployment
To use setup.py when setting up your friend's computer as a worker node:
1. Copy your entire project folder to your friend's computer, including setup.py
2. Have your friend run the setup script:  	python setup.py 
3. The script will:
	◦Check Python compatibility
	◦Install all required dependencies
	◦Create platform-appropriate startup scripts
4. After running setup.py, your friend can start worker nodes using the generated scripts:  # On Windows
	start_worker.bat --server YOUR_IP_ADDRESS	
# On macOS/Linux
	./start_worker.sh --server YOUR_IP_ADDRESS 
Start workers on additional computers:

On each worker computer, open a terminal/command prompt
Navigate to the folder with the code
Start workers using your laptop's IP address:

On Windows:
	worker_manager.bat start 2 --server YOUR_LAPTOP_IP

On macOS/Linux:
	./worker_manager.sh start 2 --server YOUR_LAPTOP_IP
