Option 1: Using the Worker Manager
The simplest way to add a worker node is to use the worker_manager.py script on the machine you want to add as a worker:

1. Copy the necessary files to the new machine:
	worker.py
	worker_manager.py
	Any required dependencies


2. Install the required dependencies:
	pip install pyzmq

3. Start workers on the new machine by running:
	python worker_manager.py start 2 --server YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
For example, to start 2 worker processes connecting to a server at classroom.example.edu:
python worker_manager.py start 2 --server classroom.example.edu

4. Verify the workers are connected by checking the worker status:
	python worker_manager.py status --server classroom.example.edu


Option 2: Starting Workers Directly
You can also start worker processes directly without using the worker manager:

1. Copy worker.py to the new machine
2. Install the required dependencies:
	pip install pyzmq

3. Start a worker process directly:
	python worker.py --server YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
For multiple workers, you can run the command multiple times or use a simple script:
for i in {1..4}; do
  python worker.py --server classroom.example.edu &
done
